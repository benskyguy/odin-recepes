    <ol>
        <li>
            Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.
            Stir in spaghetti and return to a boil. Cook spaghetti uncovered,
            stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; add bacon. Cook, turning
            occasionally, until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Add onion, celery, carrot, and oregano
            to bacon; continue cooking until vegetables begin to soften, 8 to 10 minutes. 
            Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Crumble in ground beef; cook 
            and stir until no longer pink and completely cooked, 8 to 10 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour vinegar over ground beef mixture; simmer until liquid evaporates, about 5 
            minutes. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and sugar; bring to a boil, 
            season with salt and black pepper, then remove from heat. Stir in basil . 
        </li>
        <li>
            Spoon sauce over spaghetti; top with Parmesan cheese to serve. 
        </li>
